            Building an ECG real-time dashboard can have several benefits, such as:

        <ul>

       <li>
            Early detection of heart conditions: By monitoring the ECG in real-time, healthcare professionals can detect heart conditions and abnormalities earlier, which can lead to faster diagnosis and treatment.

        </li>

        <li>
            Improved patient care: Real-time monitoring can help healthcare professionals provide more personalized care to patients. They can monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm remotely, and make changes to their treatment plan as necessary.

        </li>

        <li>
            Efficient use of resources: Real-time monitoring can help reduce the need for frequent hospital visits and unnecessary tests. Patients can be monitored remotely, which can save time, money, and resources.

        </li>

        <li>
            Improved patient outcomes: Real-time monitoring can lead to better patient outcomes, such as improved survival rates, reduced hospitalizations, and better quality of life.

        </li>

        <li>
            Research: Real-time monitoring of ECG data can be used for research purposes, such as studying the effects of medications or the progression of heart disease.
        </li>


        <li>
            Overall, building an ECG real-time dashboard can provide healthcare professionals with a valuable tool for monitoring patients' heart health, improving patient outcomes, and advancing research in the field of cardiology.
